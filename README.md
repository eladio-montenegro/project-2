switchBoard is a family command center that is meant to help families get organized.  

With switchBoard, families will be able to share a to-do maker where they can create to-do lists and shopping lists.  They will also have a shared calendar where they can add things like doctors appointments, due dates for homework, party reminders, and everything else that we always forget to do.  switchBoard will also have a recipe finder where users can find meal ideas for diner.
